# Contribution guidelines

Community contributions are welcome!

## How to propose an addition

First, search for previous pull requests to see if the project you are proposing has been discussed before.

If not, then open a new pull request with the following information:
* The PR title should be in the format of `Add project-name`.
* The PR description should describe why the library is awesome and generally useful to the community.
* The PR diff should add a single line to the [README.md](README.md) with the following format:
  ```md
  - [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description that ends with a period.
  ```
  Please check your spelling and grammar, and remove any trailing whitespace.

## Acceptance criteria

The [Connect maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) will evaluate submissions based on the project's quality, stability, and popularity.

For example:

* Does the project demonstrate best practices for Connect and the language it is written in?
* Is the project generally useful to the Connect community?
* Is the project well tested and documented?
* Is the project actively maintained (and does it have a history of being maintained over a sustained period of time)?
